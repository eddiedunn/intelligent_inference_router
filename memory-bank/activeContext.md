# Active Context: IIR MVP Phase 1a

## Current Focus
- Debugging and stabilizing Redis connectivity for test suite and FastAPILimiter integration
- Ensuring all FastAPILimiter-dependent tests run and pass using a single Redis instance for the suite
- Decoupling ml_ops: all references, submodules, and dependencies removed from IIR project (2025-04-24)

## Recent Changes
- Updated event loop handling in test fixtures and minimal Redis tests to use asyncio.run() for Python 3.11+ compatibility
- Added debug output to FastAPILimiter fixture for connection diagnosis
- Confirmed minimal Redis ping tests pass; FastAPILimiter tests still skipped due to connection/init issues
- Updated README and project documentation to reflect ml_ops decoupling

## Next Steps
- Run pytest with -s to capture all debug output from test suite
- Analyze FastAPILimiter fixture output/logs to pinpoint cause of skipped tests
- Finalize and document solution for robust Redis + FastAPILimiter test integration
- Continue monitoring for any further Redis or rate limiting issues

## Active Decisions
- Continue strict documentation-first, memory-driven workflow
- Project is now fully self-contained; ml_ops is archived/external only

## Considerations
- All context and major changes must be reflected in memory-bank for future resets
- Maintain clarity and precision in all updates, especially regarding test infra and decoupling
