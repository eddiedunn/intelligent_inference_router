> **For setup changes:** See `docs/SETUP.md`

## What Works
- Project memory initialized (projectbrief, productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext)
- .windsurfrules created for project intelligence
- Real LLM API calls working in `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- Provider client registry and routing logic validated
- 400/502 error handling robust

## What's Left to Build
- Scaffold codebase and documentation directories
- Implement FastAPI router and supporting modules
- Set up Docker Compose deployment
- Integrate Redis, Prometheus, Grafana
- Implement classification, caching, and routing logic
- Write tests and validate requirements

## Current Status
- Documentation and memory structure in place
- Ready to begin code and infra scaffolding

## Known Issues
- None at initialization
