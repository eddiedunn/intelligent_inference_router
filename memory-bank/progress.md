> **For setup changes:** See `docs/SETUP.md`

## What Works (2025-05-15)
- Model validation now robustly enforces <provider>/<model> format and normalizes IDs.
- Registry and payload matching is reliable for provider-prefixed models.
- Most tests for token/rate limit/unknown provider precedence are now correct and robust.
- Debug prints and legacy model_recommendations.json handling are removed.
## What Works
- Project memory initialized (projectbrief, productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext)
- .windsurfrules created for project intelligence
- Real LLM API calls working in `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- Provider client registry and routing logic validated
- 400/502 error handling robust

## What's Left to Build
- Scaffold codebase and documentation directories
- Implement FastAPI router and supporting modules
- Set up Docker Compose deployment
- Integrate Redis, Prometheus, Grafana
- Implement classification, caching, and routing logic
- Write tests and validate requirements

## Current Status
- Documentation and memory structure in place
- Ready to begin code and infra scaffolding

## Known Issues
- None at initialization
